First create a package for operators

Create a class named OperatorsDemo

Declare two variables a and b int type and perform arithmetic operations
on them and print out the result

Perform some comparison operations and output the result.
Hint result of comparison or relational operations is always a boolean value.

Declare two variables x and y which are int
Declare a third variable to hold the result of various increment/decrement operations
1. perform x++ + --y and store the result in result variable and discuss over the result
before your print it and finally print all variables x, y and result

Similar operation: ++x + y++ + --y
