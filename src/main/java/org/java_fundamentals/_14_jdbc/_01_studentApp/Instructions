Scenario : A.Student Register (One Table Only)
Story
A small training center wants a program to register students and manage their basic info:

Everything is stored in one table: students.

Part B — Console Program Requirements (One Table CRUD)
  Main Menu (Console)
  Add Student

  View All Students

  Find Student By ID

  Update Student

  Delete Student

  Exit


Part C — Required Layered Structure (MVC Style)
Packages
  Project structure
  src/
   └─ main/
      └─ java/
         └─ com/example/studentapp/
            ├─ App.java
            ├─ model/
            │   └─ Student.java
            ├─ view/
            │   └─ MainMenu.java
            ├─ controller/
            │   └─ StudentController.java
            ├─ service/
            │   └─ StudentService.java
            ├─ dao/
            │   ├─ StudentDAO.java
            │   └─ StudentDAOImpl.java
            └─ util/
                └─ DBConnection.java


Responsibilities (Simple Rules)

View: prints menu, reads input (Scanner), shows results

Controller: receives user request, calls service

Service: validation/business rules (ex: email not empty)

DAO: JDBC code only (SQL + PreparedStatement)

Util: DBConnection (DriverManager.getConnection)

✅ Rule for student: SQL must appear only in DAO


Part D — CRUD Actions (What student must implement)

1) Add Student
Input: name, email, phone
SQL:

INSERT INTO students(name, email, phone) VALUES (?, ?, ?);
Validation ideas (Service layer):

name not empty

email contains @

phone not empty

2) View All Students
SQL:

SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY id;
Output example:

ID: 1 | Mario Rossi | mario@email.com | 333111222 | 2026-01-03 10:12:44
3) Find Student By ID
Input: id
SQL:

SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = ?;
If not found:

Student with ID 7 not found.
4) Update Student
Input: id + new email + new phone
SQL:

UPDATE students SET email = ?, phone = ? WHERE id = ?;
If id doesn’t exist → show message.

5) Delete Student
Input: id
SQL:

DELETE FROM students WHERE id = ?;
If id doesn’t exist → show message.

Part E — JDBC Skills the Student Must Demonstrate
✅ Must use:

PreparedStatement (no Statement)

try-with-resources

executeUpdate() for insert/update/delete

executeQuery() + ResultSet for select

DBConnection.getConnection() method

Part F — Suggested User Flow (Example Run)
