Instance variables:

name (String)

damage (int)

Constructor to set these.

Method:

public void use() {
    System.out.println("Attacking with " + name + " (Damage: " + damage + ")");
}
Create a Character class

Instance variables:

name

Weapon weapon (This is Composition)

Constructor sets both.

Create method:

public void attack() {
    System.out.println(name + " is attacking!");
    weapon.use();
}
In main()

Create a Character with a Sword weapon.

10. 🏦 SafeBank Account Management System (with Composition)
    🎯 Goal
    A small bank called SafeBank wants to create a simple console-based banking system that allows:


    Users to register themselves

    Users to log in using a secure credential check

    Customers to manage their bank account (deposit, withdraw, transfer, check balance)

    Admins to approve new accounts, deactivate users, and view user lists

    The system will store users and accounts in memory using ArrayList and provide menu navigation
    using loops and switch statements.



    🧠 Concepts Covered
    This project reinforces all previously learned Java OOP concepts, plus composition:


    Concept             	Description
    Classes & Objects	    Used to model real-world entities like Customer, Account, Admin
    Inheritance	            Admin and Customer both inherit from the User class
    Polymorphism	        Shared behaviors are accessed through the common User type
    Encapsulation	        Fields are private and accessed through getters/setters
    Constructors	        Used to initialize user and account data when objects are created
    ArrayList	            Stores all system users dynamically
    Switch + Loops	        Used for menu navigation and repeated interaction
    Exception Handling	    Prevents crashes due to invalid input or operations
    Composition ★	        A Customer has-a Account — strong ownership relationship


    ⭐ Key Focus: Composition
    In this system:

    Customer  has-a  Account
    The Customer class contains an Account object.

    This means:

    Without a Customer, the Account should not exist independently

    The Customer owns and controls the Account object

    This models reality: a bank account belongs to one customer

    This is different from inheritance (is-a relationship).

    Here we use a has-a relationship (composition).



    🧩 System Design Overview

    Class                        	Responsibility
    User (abstract)     	        Base class storing username, password, role, approval state
    Admin (extends User)	        Approves & manages customers
    Customer (extends User)	        Performs deposits, withdrawals, transfers
    Account                      	Stores balance and handles account transactions
    UserManager	                    Registers users, authenticates login, searches & lists users
    Menu	                        Controls program flow and menus
    InvalidInputException	        Ensures safe and meaningful user input handling


    🏗 Step-by-Step Build Guide (Same Structure, With Composition Highlighted)

    Step 1 — Create an abstract User class
        Contains shared attributes and behaviors.

    Step 2 — Create Admin and Customer subclasses
        ✔ Both inherit from User

        ✔ Enforce role-based behavior

    Step 3 — Create the Account class
        ✔ Stores balance

        ✔ Provides deposit, withdraw, transfer methods

        ✔ Will be composed inside Customer

    Step 4 — Add composition inside Customer
        private Account account = new Account();
        This ensures every customer owns exactly one account.

    Step 5 — Implement UserManager
        Handles registration, login/authenticate, approval, lookup operations.

    Step 6 — Implement Menu navigation with switch and loops
        Separate menus for:

        Guest (Register / Login)

        Admin

        Customer

    Step 7 — Add Exception Handling
        Invalid login → show message, do not crash

        Negative deposit/withdraw → prevent the operation

        Overdraft → block withdrawal or transfer

        Hint: use this exception,
        public class InvalidInputException extends Exception {
            public InvalidInputException(String message) {
                super(message);
            }
        }
