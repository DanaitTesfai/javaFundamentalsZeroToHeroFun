1. Hotel Billing System (with Casting and String Methods)
Scenario (Instruction to Student):
A hotel wants to build a simple program to generate a bill for its guests.
The system should collect the guestâ€™s name, number of nights, and nightly rate.
It then calculates the total cost and shows it in uppercase, using string methods
and basic casting.



   Output Example:

=== Hotel Billing System ===
Enter guest name: Marta
Enter number of nights: 3
Enter price per night: 49.99

--- BILL SUMMARY ---
Customer: MARTA
Nights: 3
Nightly Rate: $49.99
Total amount: $149.97
