📘 Scenario-Based Problem
🏫 Student–Course Enrollment Management System
🎭 Real-World Story
A small training institute wants to digitalize how it manages:

Students

Courses

Which students are enrolled in which courses

Currently, everything is written in notebooks. This causes problems such as:

Duplicate enrollments

Losing track of which student joined which course

Difficulty updating or removing records

You are asked to build a console-based application using an MVC-like layered architecture, where files act as the database.

🧱 System Overview
The system must manage two core entities (models):

✅ Model 1: Student
✅ Model 2: Course
And a relationship between them:
➡ Enrollment (Student ↔ Course)

📦 Models (Data Objects)
🧑 Student Model
Each student has:

studentId (unique, auto-generated)

name

Stored in file:

students_db.txt
Example:

1,John Doe
2,Emma White
📚 Course Model
Each course has:

courseId (unique, auto-generated)

courseName

Stored in file:

courses_db.txt
Example:

1,Java Programming
2,Web Development
🔗 Enrollment Model (Relationship File)
Represents which student is enrolled in which course.

Fields:

enrollmentId

studentId

courseId

Stored in:

enrollments_db.txt
Example:

1,1,2   → (EnrollmentID 1: Student 1 enrolled in Course 2)

🗂 Architecture Layers (Very Important)
Controller Layer
        ↓
Service Layer
        ↓
Repository Layer
        ↓
Text Files (DB)
🧱 REQUIRED CLASSES (Conceptually)
Layer	Classes
Model	Student, Course, Enrollment
Repository	StudentRepository, CourseRepository, EnrollmentRepository
Service	StudentService, CourseService, EnrollmentService
Controller	MainController (menu handling)
🎯 Functional Requirements
🔹 Student Management
    Add student

    View all students

    Delete student (by ID)

Business rules:

    Student name cannot be empty

    Duplicate student names not allowed

🔹 Course Management
    Add course

    View all courses

    Delete course (by ID)

Business rules:

    Course name must be unique

    Course name cannot be empty

🔹 Enrollment Management (Most Important Part)
    Enroll a student in a course

    View all enrollments

    Remove enrollment

Business rules (Service Layer rules):

    Student must exist

    Course must exist

    A student cannot be enrolled in the same course twice

    If a student is deleted → their enrollments must be deleted

    If a course is deleted → related enrollments must be deleted

🔁 Data Flow Example (Very Important for Understanding)
Example: Enroll Student in Course
User Input
   ↓
Controller (read IDs)
   ↓
EnrollmentService
   ├─ check student exists → StudentRepository
   ├─ check course exists → CourseRepository
   ├─ check duplicate enrollment → EnrollmentRepository
   ↓
EnrollmentRepository saves to file
   ↓
Controller prints result
🎓 Learning Outcomes for Students
By completing this problem, a student will understand:

✅ How multiple models interact
✅ How multiple repositories work together
✅ Why Service layer is essential
✅ How to avoid duplicate records
✅ How file-based persistence mimics a real database
✅ How MVC ideas apply even in console apps

=========================
✅ C) STEP-BY-STEP GUIDANCE
=========================
🪜 Step 1
Create Model classes (POJOs only, no logic)

✅ Student
✅ Course
✅ Enrollment

🪜 Step 2
Create Repository layer

One repo = one file

Only I/O logic

No validation

🪜 Step 3
Create Service layer

Business rules live here

Cross-repo checks

Prevent duplicates

Validate existence

🪜 Step 4
Create Controller

Menu

Input/output

Calls only Service/Repo methods

🪜 Step 5
Create Main


Starts controller

Nothing else
