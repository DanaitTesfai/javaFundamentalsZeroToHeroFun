1.  Goal: Print numbers from 1 to N on one line, space-separated.
Steps:

Read integer N (assume N ≥ 1).

Use a for loop from i = 1 to i <= N.

Print i followed by a space (don’t add a newline until the end).

After the loop, print a newline.
--------------------------

2. Sum 1 to N
   Goal: Compute the sum 1 + 2 + … + N.
   Steps:

   Read N.

   Initialize sum = 0.

   Loop i from 1 to N (inclusive).

   Add i to sum each iteration.

   Print sum.
----------------------------
3. Even Numbers Up To N
   Goal: Print all even numbers from 2 to N.
   Steps:

   Read N.

   Use a for loop starting at i = 2; step by i += 2 while i <= N.

   Print i each time.
   -----------------------------
   4.Multiplication Table of a Number
     Goal: Print the table of X from X×1 to X×10.
     Steps:

     Read X.

     Loop i from 1 to 10.

     Print X + " x " + i + " = " + (X * i).
     ---------------------------------------------
     5. Goal: Print numbers from N down to 1.
        Steps:

        Read N.

        Use a while loop with i = N and decrement i-- until i >= 1.

        Print i each iteration.
        -----------------------------------

        6. Hotel Billing System with Multiple Guests (Loops, Casting, and String Methods)

           Scenario (Instruction to Student):
           A hotel wants to upgrade its billing program so that it can handle multiple
           guests in one run. The system should ask the user how many guests they want
            to process, then use a loop to repeat the billing process for each guest.

           For each guest, collect:

           Guest’s name

           Number of nights

           Nightly rate

           The system will calculate the total cost and display the bill summary
            in uppercase using string methods. Use casting where needed
            (e.g., rounding total amount to two decimal places).

           After processing all guests, the program should display the total income
           for the day.
