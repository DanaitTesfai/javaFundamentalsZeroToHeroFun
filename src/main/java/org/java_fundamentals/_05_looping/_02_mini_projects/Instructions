1.Hotel Billing System with Multiple Guests (Loops, Casting, and String Methods)

              Scenario (Instruction to Student):
              A hotel wants to upgrade its billing program so that it can handle multiple
              guests in one run. The system should ask the user how many guests they want
               to process, then use a loop to repeat the billing process for each guest.

              For each guest, collect:

              Guestâ€™s name

              Number of nights

              Nightly rate

              The system will calculate the total cost and display the bill summary
               in uppercase using string methods. Use casting where needed
               (e.g., rounding total amount to two decimal places).

              After processing all guests, the program should display the total income
              for the day.
