1.1  NEW FEATURE REQUEST: Search Vehicles
    (Question + Implementation)

    📝 QUESTION FOR STUDENTS
    Scenario-Based Task: Search Vehicles
    Your Vehicle Rental System is already able to:

    Add vehicles

    Delete vehicles

    List all vehicles

    Rent vehicles

    Save & load data from files

    Manage users and admins

    The rental company now wants to add a Search Vehicle feature.

    🎯 Your Task
    Add a menu option that allows a user (or admin) to search for a vehicle by keyword.

    Search should work like this:

    User enters a search term (example: "toyota" or "car" or "bike")

    System should search inside:

    vehicle model

    AND vehicle type

    Search must be case-insensitive

    Display all matching vehicles

    If nothing found, show:

    No matching vehicles found.
    📝 Requirements
    Add a new menu option:

    4. Search Vehicle
    (for admin and/or user menu)

    Implement a method inside RentalSystem:

    public void searchVehicle(String keyword)
    This method should loop through vehicles ArrayList and display matches.

    Searching should not modify any data.

    💡 HINTS FOR STUDENTS
    Use .toLowerCase() for case-insensitive search

    Check if model/type .contains(keyword)

    Use a boolean flag to track if any result was found

    Hint: if (v.model.toLowerCase().contains(keyword) ||
        v.type.toLowerCase().contains(keyword)) {
        // a match
    }

    Enter keyword: tesla

    🔍 Search Results for: tesla
    No matching vehicles found.
