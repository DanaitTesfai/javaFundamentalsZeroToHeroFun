---------------------------------------------------------------
1.1  NEW FEATURE REQUEST: Search Vehicles
    (Question + Implementation)

    📝 QUESTION FOR STUDENTS
    Scenario-Based Task: Search Vehicles
    Your Vehicle Rental System is already able to:

    Add vehicles

    Delete vehicles

    List all vehicles

    Rent vehicles

    Save & load data from files

    Manage users and admins

    The rental company now wants to add a Search Vehicle feature.

    🎯 Your Task
    Add a menu option that allows a user (or admin) to search for a vehicle by keyword.

    Search should work like this:

    User enters a search term (example: "toyota" or "car" or "bike")

    System should search inside:

    vehicle model

    AND vehicle type

    Search must be case-insensitive

    Display all matching vehicles

    If nothing found, show:

    No matching vehicles found.
    📝 Requirements
    Add a new menu option:

    4. Search Vehicle
    (for admin and/or user menu)

    Implement a method inside RentalSystem:

    public void searchVehicle(String keyword)
    This method should loop through vehicles ArrayList and display matches.

    Searching should not modify any data.

    💡 HINTS FOR STUDENTS
    Use .toLowerCase() for case-insensitive search

    Check if model/type .contains(keyword)

    Use a boolean flag to track if any result was found

    Hint: if (v.model.toLowerCase().contains(keyword) ||
        v.type.toLowerCase().contains(keyword)) {
        // a match
    }

    Enter keyword: tesla

    🔍 Search Results for: tesla
    No matching vehicles found.
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 QUESTION FOR STUDENTS: Update Vehicle Details
    Scenario-Based Task
    The rental company reports that sometimes vehicle information is incorrect or needs to be changed.
    For example:

    A vehicle's model name was typed incorrectly

    Price per day needs adjustment

    Type needs correction (Car → SUV)

    They want to add a new feature:

    🎯 Update Vehicle Details
    Your task is to:

    Add a menu option:

    Update Vehicle
    Ask the admin for:

    Vehicle ID to update

    New model

    New type

    New price

    Update the vehicle in the vehicles ArrayList

    Save the updated vehicles to the file

    If the ID does not exist, display a message

    Vehicle not found.
    💡 Hints for Students
    Use a loop to find the vehicle by ID (for(Vehicle v : vehicles))

    Compare with: if(v.id == id)

    If found, update fields:

    v.model = newModel;
    v.type = newType;
    v.pricePerDay = newPrice;
    Use a boolean to track if anything was found

    Don’t forget to call saveVehiclesToFile()

    🧪 SAMPLE OUTPUTS
    Scenario A — Successful Update
    ==== ADMIN MENU ====
    1. Add Vehicle
    2. Delete Vehicle
    3. List Vehicles
    4. Search Vehicle
    5. Update Vehicle
    6. Logout
    Choice: 5

    Enter vehicle ID to update: 101
    Enter new model: Toyota Corolla X
    Enter new type: Car
    Enter new price per day: 50

    ✏️ Vehicle updated successfully!
--------------------------------------------------

1.3 QUESTION FOR STUDENTS (Assignment)
    Scenario-Based Task: Manage Vehicle Availability
    You are upgrading the Vehicle Rental System.
    The rental company has asked you to add Vehicle Availability Management.

    New Requirements
    Every vehicle must have an availability flag:

    true → Available

    false → Rented

    When a user rents a vehicle:

    Mark that vehicle as not available

    When listing vehicles:
    Show:

    101 - Toyota Corolla (Car) - $45/day - AVAILABLE
    102 - Honda CBR (Motorbike) - $30/day - NOT AVAILABLE
    When renting:

    Only allow renting vehicles that are available

    If the vehicle is not available, show:

    Sorry, this vehicle is already rented.
    Update file saving logic to include availability.

    Update file loading logic to read availability back.

    💡 HINTS FOR STUDENTS
    Add a boolean field:

    boolean available;
    Set default availability to true when adding a vehicle

    In rentVehicle():

    Check if(v.available == false) → reject rental

    Otherwise → v.available = false;

    When writing to file:

    id,model,type,price,available
    When reading from file:

    Use Boolean.parseBoolean(data[4])
