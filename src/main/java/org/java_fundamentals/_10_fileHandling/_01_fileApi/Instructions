A. Basic Concepts
Exercise 1: Create and Write
Create a Java program that:

Creates a file named student.txt

Writes your name and your favorite subject into it.

Goal: Practice file creation and writing.
------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 2: Append Data
Modify the previous program to append the current date and time into the file.

Hint:

Use:


new FileWriter("student.txt", true)
---------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 3: Read File

Write a program to read the contents of student.txt and print them to the console.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 4: Count Lines
Read the file and print how many lines the file contains.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 5: Delete File
Ask the user:

Do you want to delete the file? (yes/no)
If yes → delete the file.
If no → exit safely.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

B. Scenario based
Scenario: Mini Library Management System
🎭 Real-Life Background Story
Your community has a small public library that keeps track of its books using pen and paper.
 The librarian often struggles to:

Remember which books are in the library

Record new books when donated

Show the current list of books to visitors

To make the librarian's job easier, you have been asked to create a simple computer program
that manages books in the library.

🧱 What the System Should Do
The program must allow the librarian to:

✅ 1. Add Books
Each book has:

Title (Example: The Hobbit)

Author (Example: J.R.R. Tolkien)

When a book is added, it should be stored immediately so that the data is not lost even if the program closes.

✅ 2. View All Books
The librarian can request the list of all books currently in the library.

The books should be displayed neatly, one per line.

✅ 3. Save Data Permanently
All book information must be stored in a text file named:

library.txt
This ensures that even if the computer is turned off, the data remains.

✅ 4. Load Data When the Program Starts
When the program starts, it should check if library.txt exists:

If yes → load all books from it into memory

If not → create a new empty file

This allows the system to continue from previous sessions.

🛠 Concepts the Student Must Use
Concept	                  Requirement                           	Reason
Classes & Objects	      Create Book and Library classes	        To follow OOP principles
Composition	              Library contains a List of Book objects	To represent a real-world library
ArrayList	              Store books in memory                  	Dynamic storage
FileWriter / File	      Save books permanently	                File handling
Scanner	                  Read user input and read from file	    Console interaction & file reading
Menu + Switch	          Show options repeatedly	                User-friendly navigation

Step-by-Step Instructions for Students
1. Create a Book class

    Fields: title, author

    Constructor + toString() override for printing

2. Create a Library class

    It should have an ArrayList<Book>

    Methods:

    addBook(Book book)

    showBooks()

    saveToFile()

    loadFromFile()

3. Create a Main class

    Load books from file when the program starts.

    Provide a menu with choices:

    Add Book

    View Books

    Save & Exit

4. When a new book is added, also:

    Add it to ArrayList

Save to the file
🧩 Program Structure
1. Book Class
Represents a single book.

2. Library Class
Manages a list of books:

Add a book

Show all books

Save to file

Load from file

3. Main Class
Displays the menu and interacts with the user.

🖥 Sample User Interaction
===== Mini Library Menu =====
1. Add Book
2. View All Books
3. Save & Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter Book Title: The Hobbit
Enter Book Author: J.R.R. Tolkien
Book added successfully!

===== Mini Library Menu =====
1. Add Book
2. View All Books
3. Save & Exit
Enter choice: 2

📚 Books in Library:
- The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
🎯 Student Learning Outcomes
After completing this program, the student will understand:

How to store multiple objects using ArrayList

How to use Composition (Library HAS Books)

How to read/write files using Java I/O

How to build interactive console menus

How to save data permanently

Continuation of B

📌 System Update
Scenario 1 — Delete a Book from the Library
🎭 Real-Life Story
Over time, some books in the library become damaged, lost, or outdated.
The librarian wants the ability to remove these books from the system so that the library record stays accurate.

🎯 New Requirement
Add a feature that allows the librarian to delete a book by title.

🧩 Expected Behavior
Librarian selects: Delete Book

System asks:
"Enter the title of the book to remove:"

If book found → remove it from:

The ArrayList

The library.txt file

Display: "Book removed successfully."

If book not found → display: "Book not found."

💡 Learning Outcome
Students practice:

Searching inside ArrayList

Removing objects

Saving updated data to file
