ap Exercise 1: Employee Directory
Program Description:
Write a Java program that stores employee IDs and employee names in a map and prints all employees.

Sample Output:

Employee Directory:
101 - Alice
102 - Bob
103 - John

NOTE:
Entry<String, Integer> is a nested interface inside the Map interface that represents a key-value pair.
            It has two main methods: getKey() and getValue().
            It acts like a container to hold both the key and value together. And we can use it to iterate through the map easily.
            It is similar to a type of object that holds both key and value.

            for(Student s : students){
            ...
            }

            Map<K, V> map = new HashMap<>();
            for(Map.Entry<K,V> entry : map.entrySet()){
            entry.getKey();--------> returns the key
            entry.getValue();--------> returns the value
            }
