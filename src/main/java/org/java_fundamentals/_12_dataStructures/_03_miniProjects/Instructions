📍 Background
A private training institute conducts multiple short-term technology courses
(e.g., Java, Spring, Database, Web Development).

Until now, student records were stored manually in notebooks.
This caused:

Duplicate student IDs

Lost records

No easy way to search or display data

The institute wants a simple Java console application that:

Works offline

Stores data permanently in a file

Follows clean layered architecture (MVC)

🎯 BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
The system must:

Register students with unique student IDs

Store student data persistently in a file

Display all registered students

Prevent duplicate student registrations

Be easy to maintain and extend

Use good OOP and design practices

📘 FUNCTIONAL USE CASES
Use Case	       Description
Add Student	       Register a new student
View Students	   Display all students
Exit System	Safely terminate program
🧩 CLASS-BY-CLASS INSTRUCTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)
✅ MODEL LAYER
🔹 Person (ABSTRACT CLASS)
Purpose:
Represents a generic human entity in the system.

Why abstract?
Because a Person alone doesn’t make sense — only specific types like students.

Fields (Protected):
Field	    Type  	Description
id	        int	    Unique identifier
name    	String	Person’s full name
Methods:
Method	Description
getRole()	Abstract → implemented by subclasses
getId()	Returns ID
getName()	Returns name
public abstract String getRole();
🔹 Student (CONCRETE CLASS)
Purpose:
Represents a student enrolled in the institute.

Inheritance:
Student extends Person

Fields:
Field	Type	Description
course	String	Course enrolled (Java, Spring, etc.)
Responsibilities:
Hold student data

Convert itself into a file-friendly format

@Override
public String toString() {
    return id + "," + name + "," + course;
}
✅ OOP Concepts:
Inheritance, overriding, encapsulation

✅ REPOSITORY LAYER (FILE MANAGEMENT MOVED HERE ✅)
🔹 StudentRepository (INTERFACE)
Purpose:
Defines WHAT operations are required
(does not care HOW data is stored).

Methods:
Method	Description
save(Student)	Persist student
findAll()	Load all students
void save(Student student) throws Exception;
List<Student> findAll() throws Exception;
🔹 FileStudentRepository (IMPLEMENTATION)
Purpose:
Handles ALL FILE OPERATIONS related to students.

📌 File is stored as:

students.txt
📌 File format (CSV):

101,Alice,Java
102,Bob,Spring
Responsibilities:
Create file if missing

Append new student records

Read student data from file

Convert text → Student objects

✅ File I/O belongs HERE ONLY
✅ Controller / Service should NOT know files exist
